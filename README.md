# Radium

| :bangbang: | I would recommend that you don't run your own instance of this bot and instead invite the main instance of the bot using this invite: [inv.shivs.me](https://inv.shivs.me) |
| :--------: | :------------------------------------ |


Radium exposes information about your server to a RESTful API at `radium.shivs.me/:guildId`.


You can specify the scope of data required by the include query parameter. The 3 options are minimum, basic and all. If a query paramter is not specified, it defaults to basic.

If you wish to stop exposing this server on the API, simply kick the bot and you are good to go. No data is stored by the bot itself but other applications may track and store data exposed by the API.
